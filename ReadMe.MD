## Create a new repo on GitHub ##

After you login or create your [GitHub](https://github.com/)  account, create a new repository on GitHub. You can name it whatever you want, but I‚Äôll name it `yourusername.github.io` (of course, replace ‚Äúyourusername‚Äù with your actual GitHub username).

*OR*

You can do as I did, with Visual Studio Code, and create a new folder with the name of your github username plus .github.io, in my case `ThomasSKokholm.github.io`.

Then open Visual Studio Code from the console prompt/Powershell/Terminal or whatever console or terminal program you use.
Then type `code .` to open Visual Studio Code in the current folder.

After that you can either create your own simple static website from scratch, or you can use a template from the internet.
In this case I did use a [Jerkyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) template from [HTML5 UP! Responsive HTML5 and CSS3 Site Templates](https://html5up.net/) eg. these [Aerial](https://html5up.net/aerial), [Astral](https://html5up.net/astral) and [striped](https://html5up.net/striped) .

Unpack(un-zip) the template you chose to the folder you made and open in VSCode.

go to [gitignore.io - Create Useful .gitignore Files For Your Project](https://gitignore.io/) or use [My .gitignore file](https://www.toptal.com/developers/gitignore/api/visualstudiocode), put it in a new file in your folder and name it '.gitignore' (without the quotes).

Then open the terminal in VSCode and type `git init` to initialize the git repository.

Then go 2 source control Ctrl+Shift+G

Commit your changes, and then push them to your newly created github repo, make sure its public üòâ
